description: "Erewhon: or, Over the Range (e-re-whon) is a novel by Samuel Butler\
  \ which was first published anonymously in 1872. The title is also the name of a\
  \ country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist. In the novel, it is not revealed\
  \ where Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a fictional country. Butler meant\
  \ the title to be read as \"nowhere\" backwards even though the letters \"h\" and\
  \ \"w\" are transposed, as it would have been pronounced in his day (and still is\
  \ in some dialects of English). The book is a satire on Victorian society.\nThe\
  \ first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are in fact\
  \ based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand where, as a young man, he worked\
  \ as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station for about four years (1860â€“64), and explored\
  \ parts of the interior of the South Island and which he wrote about in his A First\
  \ Year in Canterbury Settlement (1863).\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
